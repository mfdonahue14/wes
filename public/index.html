				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>The Wesleyan Entrepreneurship Society was forged two years ago to ignite the entrepreneurial spirit at Wesleyan by providing its members the necessary skills, resources and support to ideate, innovate, and change the world. The society aims to become the place for students who share a common interest in generating change and/or honing their entreprenurial skills to congregate on-campus through weekly lecture series and hands-on workshops. And while a select few members joined the collective with an impressive memoranda of business experience to decorate their resumes, we pride ourselves in helping anyone and everyone, no matter their skill level, become a student entrepreneur.</p>
				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>The common denominator of our members is their passion. They are determined, hard-working and sprited students. Over the years, our members have started non-profit organizations, built websites and web applications, and turned their hobbies into sustainable businesses. We have hosted business skill workshops, invited alumni to meetings and organized numerous events relating to entrepreneurship at Wesleyan. We look forward to continuing to foster the entrepreneurial culture both on and off campus.</p>

          <h4><b>Yekaterina (Katya) Sapozhnina</b><br>
						Founder/President</h4>
					<a href="https://twitter.com/Katya2494" target="_blank" class="icon icon-twitter"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="http://lnkd.in/_AFedV" target="_blank" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="mailto:ysapozhnina@wesleyan.edu" class="fa fa-envelope"></a>
					<p align="left">Katya founded (WES)<sup>2</sup> in January 2013 when she realized that Wesleyan was the perfect environment for ideation and innovation, yet lacked a prominent entrepreneurship culture. And so, the entrepreneur decided to spearhead it herself.  Kat is going to be a Junior at Wesleyan University. She has attended many business workshops including those hosted by StartingBloc and DoSomething. She is a Peer Advisor for the Patricelli Center of Social Entrepreneurship, a center that (WES)<sup>2</sup> works closely with. Kate has been advising various start-ups on campus and working on several of her own ventures. This upcoming spring semester, she will be co-leading a for-credit student forum about entrepreneurship for the second time. Some of her passions include disability rights, neuroscience and art history. Katherine cares a lot about raising the self-esteem of children and providing more opportunities for struggling immigrants. She is big on self-improvement and positive psychology. Just like wearing many hats, Katya rocks a lot of nicknames (as you might have noticed by now).

					<a href="www.linkedin.com/in/dniehoff/" target="_blank" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<a href="mailto:dniehoff@wesleyan.edu" class="fa fa-envelope"></a>
					<p align="left">Dylan is a rising senior at Wesleyan University. He was always drawn to entrepreneurship from a very early age, but it wasn’t until college when he really began to enhance his knowledge on the vast entrepreneurial landscape. Last year, he enrolled in Katya's student forum on Entrepreneurship at Wesleyan and it inspired him to co-lead the class this spring and become more engaged in the entrepreneurial scene on campus. He’s been an active member of Wesleyan Entrepreneurship Society (WES)² for over a year and is now standing Vice President and Budget Chairmen. He strongly believes the road to success is always under construction, so he strives to continue his learning both in and out of the classroom. Moreover, he’s knowledgeable in a diverse range of subjects that are of interest to him such as Psychology, Economics, Finance and Marketing. Along with having a concentration in Psychology and majoring in Economics, he also received an online diploma in Digital Marketing. He enjoys having a strong presence throughout the Wesleyan community and is currently a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He also takes pleasure in mentoring and helping those that reach out to him, so don’t be afraid to do so!</p>
